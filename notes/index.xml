I was only doing enough to get by the immediate tasks. I have been very unfocused in general and procrastinating. And that, in turn, made me go on tangents with other stuff which were more interesting.
Today I had a few deadlines to meet. It made me sit through the first part of the day working on the task. But I still was pretty unfocused for the most part, even though I delivered my tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
