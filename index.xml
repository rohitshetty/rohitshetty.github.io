This is NOT a book review.
I do not feel comfortable judging something of which I do not have a complete understanding. I am a very naive reader and, this is just a documentation of things that the book made me feel through the process of reading it.
Living with Em, having survived her into adolescence, we’d earned the right to be her equals.

I love coming across blogs from the 2000s that document an era in tech and society that I lived through but know nothing about. I love blogs that are more of a diary, a running commentary of a thought process of the project than a straightforward tutorial.
I do not plan to do any of those. But I wanted to keep a log of things I dabble in, read, and other random things that I do, outside of my day-to-day work.</description></item></channel></rss>
