# Writing Style Guide

_Based on comprehensive analysis of markdown files from rohitshetty.github.io blog_

## Overview

This style guide captures the distinctive writing voice and patterns found across blog posts, weekly notes, technical documentation, and personal essays. The goal is to maintain consistency while preserving the authentic, evolving nature of the writing.

## Core Writing Characteristics

### Radical Honesty & Vulnerability

- Write with remarkable openness about mental health struggles, depression, ADHD, burnout, and existential crises
- No subject feels off-limits - discuss medication, therapy, productivity struggles, and self-doubt with equal candor
- Include honest temporal markers: _"I haven't written weekly notes for 2 months"_, _"It has been approximately 2 months since..."_
- **Example**: _"I'm feeling helpless and hopeless. I can't seem to tame myself or my flaws."_

### Philosophical Depth

- Engage seriously with big questions about meaning, faith, absurdism, and human nature
- Reference thinkers like Camus, Dr. Ambedkar, and philosophical concepts woven naturally into personal narrative
- Don't just report experiences - examine their deeper implications
- Connect personal struggles to broader human themes
- **Example**: _"The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need (for meaning) and the unreasonable silence of the universe (To quote Camus)"_

### Technical Precision with Accessibility

- When explaining technical concepts (coffee brewing, photography development, coding), be methodical and clear
- Include honest warnings about limitations: _"Very bad/basic understanding of philosophy ahead"_
- Provide clean, well-commented code examples with full context
- Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- **Specify exact tools, versions, and measurements**: "GTK+ 3 and RPC library in Python", "5'50" min/km for 7K", "38 degree C, felt like 48 degree C"
- Include troubleshooting and failure documentation alongside successes

### Stream-of-Consciousness Flow

- Let thoughts connect through association rather than linear structure
- Follow tangents and return to main points organically
- Use parenthetical asides and dashes to create conversational rhythm
- Allow for natural wandering while maintaining overall coherence
- **Example**: _"I find the whole ritual of taking a photo on a film very peaceful. Because you only have 36 exposure - you usually tend to be bit more careful and present."_

### Present-Moment Awareness

- Include strong sensory details: _"It was a calm Tuesday afternoon, disturbed aperiodically by the traffic on the 100ft road"_
- Capture specific moments with precision and mindfulness
- Ground abstract concepts in concrete experiences
- Document weather, physical sensations, immediate environment
- **Example**: _"I made myself some coffee in a French Press, and I am writing this memory down as I sip in my hot coffee."_

### Data-Driven Reflection

- Include specific measurements and metrics: running distances, sleep hours, build times, temperatures
- Use precise timestamps and durations
- Document progress with quantifiable markers
- Connect quantitative data to qualitative experiences
- **Example**: _"Week 1: 40.27 km, Week 2: 42.49 km, Week 3: 47.74 km"_

## Recurring Themes to Explore

- **Identity and self-doubt**: Constant questioning of abilities and worth
- **Learning as process**: Documentation of ongoing education (Urdu, photography, running, etc.)
- **Mental health**: ADHD, depression, therapy, medication decisions, burnout cycles
- **Physical transformation**: Running journey, fitness, body acceptance, strength discovery
- **Creative obsessions**: Photography, coffee, technical projects, maker culture
- **Work and burnout**: Struggles with productivity and professional identity
- **Cultural bridge-building**: Connecting different languages, traditions, ways of knowing
- **Community and mentorship**: Appreciation for colleagues, coaches, learning communities
- **Process over outcomes**: Documenting the journey, failures, and iterative improvement

## Final Notes

The strength of this writing lies not in polished expertise but in the genuine documentation of a thoughtful person navigating complexity with honesty, precision, and continuous learning. The voice works because it's authentically curious, technically engaged, philosophically questioning, and personally vulnerable - all while maintaining a commitment to growth and community.

Preserve the integration of different domains of knowledge and experience. Keep the balance of confidence in technical matters with humility about life's bigger questions. Continue documenting the process of becoming rather than claiming to have arrived. Maintain the specificity in measurements, tools, and temporal markers that ground abstract concepts in concrete reality.

**For AI tools**: This guide serves as a comprehensive framework for maintaining voice consistency while allowing for natural evolution. Pay particular attention to the balance between vulnerability and technical precision, the integration of quantitative data with qualitative reflection, and the honest documentation of both successes and failures in the learning process.
