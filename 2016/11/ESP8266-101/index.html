      <p><strong><em>Introduction to ESP8266 </em></strong></p>
      <p>ESP8266 is an answer to most of the projects that requires internet/wi-fi connectivity.</p>
      <p>It is lowcost (around 3$) and its specifications are much much better than atmega’s(or arduino’s that use atmega).<br>It runs at 80MHz has 32 bit CPU with 64+96 KB of iRAM+dataRAM, and SPI Flash storage of least of 512KB!.<br>It supports IEEE 802.11
        b/g/n WiFi.
        <br>Also the power consumption is decent!<br>Considering the cost this is a steal!.</p>
      <p>ESP8266 is a must toy for EC/CS students. The concepts of Computer Networking, Operating systems, Embedded systems and microcontrollers all can be learnt hands-on using this one tiny chip!.</p>
      <p>ESP8266 can connect to other WiFi Access Points(such as your WiFi router) as station or be the Acess Point itself(like your mobile hotspot, but without internet) where other devices can connect to it and a third mode exists where it acts as both
        station and access point.</p>
      <p>There are 2 most used ways to use ESP8266 in your project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As WiFi to Serial modem using AT commands</li>
        <li>Standalone mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most people use it as WiFi to serial modem. ESP8266 comes with AT firmware flashed. Which means you can send AT styled Commands over UART from other controllers(like Arduino) to ESP8266.</p>
      <p>For example to list all the wifi access points you would send <code>AT+CWLAP</code> from your Arduino over serial port.</p>
      <p>Although this is simple to use there are tradeoffs. Downside is designs would need one more microcontroller to send commands to ESP(usually its the arduino).<br>It is shame to waste so much processing power that comes with ESP8266 :( It is like
        using another vehicle to tow your car. It maybe needed in some usecase, but for most of the time we are better off not using it like this. </p>
      <p>Standalone method uses the processor on ESP8266 itself as application processor. Hence reducing need of extra controller.<br>ESP8266 has 17 GPIO pins (number of exposed pins can vary from version to version for example ESP-1 had 4 GPIO and ESP12
        module had 11 GPIO pins).<br>The plus side is access to faster CPU, larger RAM and flash storage.</p>
      <p>ESP8266 can be programmed directly using many methods out of which below are the common ones</p>
      <p> <strong><a href="http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html" target="_blank" rel="external">NodeMCU</a></strong></p>
      <p> NodeMCU is an opensource IOT Platform. You can use <em>lua</em> scripting language to code the ESP8266. Community is very matured and it is very easy to learn. Lua is asyncronous like JavaScript.</p>
      <p> <strong><a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino" target="_blank" rel="external">Arduino interface based</a> </strong></p>
      <p> This can be used to code ESP8266 using Arduino IDE. This is by far the most easiest one. But if experience has taught us anything, it’s that the easy way out may not always lead to paradise. This introduces performance tradeoffs and is not prefered
        for some serious design.</p>
      <p> <strong><a href="http://hackaday.com/2016/07/21/micropython-on-the-esp8266-kicking-the-tires/" target="_blank" rel="external">MicroPython</a></strong></p>
      <p> Its everyone’s favourite python on ESP8266!. I am yet to check this out, but again may have performance tradeoffs.</p>
      <p> <strong><a href="https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki" target="_blank" rel="external">Native SDK</a></strong></p>
      <p> This is the most powerful of all methods. Like all things with power, this too is feared. It has a steep learning curve, and tutorial around this are hard to find. This overcomes performance bottlenecks of the above methods.<br> This uses <em>C</em></p>
      <p> Espressif releases their SDK’s periodically which can be used to code ESP8266. These comes in 2 formats.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>RTOS based SDK.</li>
        <li>Non RTOS, callback based SDK.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I perfer using native SDK and <em>C</em>, well because its more fun to work at baremetal levels.<br>I am still learning to work around with ESP8266 and hopefully i will try to document them.</p>
      <p>Till then,<br>Happy tinkering.</p>
      <p>PS: There is this new kid in the block called ESP32 check him out!.</p>
