Recently, I tried [Black Baza's Whisky Barrel aged coffee](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/whiskey-sub?variant=41941243986102) and enjoyed its the taste and after note. However, due to various reasons, I didn't drink coffee for a while. When I finally resumed my coffee consumption, I found the boozy notes to be overpowering. So, I decided to save the beans for a cold brew later.

This weekend, I ordered a [new bag of coffee beans from Blue Tokai](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/hidden-falls-estate?variant=40094498029623), and I was pleasantly surprised to receive it the very next day. Living in Bangalore certainly has its privileges, including access to numerous specialty coffee shops within a one-kilometer radius of my home ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯. I can't wait to try this new coffee and see how it compares to my previous favorite.
