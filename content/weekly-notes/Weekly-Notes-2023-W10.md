## This week

- On Sunday I watched [The Pirates of Somalia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Somalia_(film)>). This is an autobiographical story of Jay Bahadur, a student who wants to be a journalist - but instead of going to a journalism school, he is advised to chase a crazy story by a senior journalist he adores. The rest of the movie is about his life in Somalia, and how that journey changed him.

  I quite liked the movie.
  Loved the character of Abdi played by the Somalian-American actor Barkhad Abdi. I also ended up binging through Wikipedia articles on Somalia. Did you know, Somalia was known as the land of poets before colonization? They used to settle arguments and disputes through poems rather than fighting or shedding bled.
