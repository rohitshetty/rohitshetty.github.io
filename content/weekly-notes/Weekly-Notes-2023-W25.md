## Last Week (2023W25)

My sleep continues to improve, but I have failed in my goal of waking up a bit earlier to have a calm day. I'm happy and proud that even on days when I worked late, I managed to get home and sleep instead of falling asleep at my desk chair - progress ðŸŽ‰.

This week was mostly dedicated to work. I had productive days for the most part, successfully completing tasks for both of my projects. One of the products our team helped build for a client was utilized in auditioning young athletes for a major sporting league. That required me to be on call for most of latter half of the week.
Currently, we are eagerly awaiting the results and feedback ðŸ¤ž.

On _Tuesday_, we celebrated my colleague Adhyayan's birthday at [Bao Bangalore](https://g.co/kgs/zJPfma). We played [Contact](https://www.ludozofi.com/home/games/contact/) while we were here. I love that game!.

In the office, we have been playing [Mafia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)>) during breaks for the past several weeks.

_Friday_ My Sister came over to Indiranagar to catch her bus back home to Belgaum, so we had dinner together at [Salt Mango Tree](https://g.co/kgs/tESymW).

Unfortunately, on _Friday_, I caught a cold. As a result, I spent most of my _Saturday_ and _Sunday_ resting at home.

While at home, I binged Season 1 & 2 of [Asur](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asur_(Indian_web_series)>), an Indian web series. I have mixed feelings about it, so maybe I will write my thoughts down.

I also discovered [Moheener Ghoraguli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moheener_Ghoraguli) this week, a pioneering Bengali Rock band from the 70s. You can find some of their iconic songs [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVNt2Vdo6q4). Although I don't understand Bangla, I really enjoy the vibes, as they say.

## Interesting Internet:

[How to make a Quill Pen?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbtJOjFv7s&ab_channel=HowToMakeEverything) - This video goes into some of the steps to make a Quill pen. I found it fascinating. Other videos in this playlist is interesting too.

[We drove from Pratt's Bottom to Balls Cross.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdxFY_wtiOI&ab_channel=TomScottplus) - Hilarious! Tom Scott, Matt Gray and Toilet humour - FTW!

_If you made it till here, you deserve some of the Orange cuteness._
