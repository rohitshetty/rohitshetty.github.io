I missed my updates for 2024W05 and was in two minds about writing this. In these two weeks, I visited my parents back in Belgaum and stayed with them for a week. I worked remotely.

I can't really remember much to write here. Days have been a blur.

We are also moving into our new office soon - so there is a lot of excitement for that.

After a long time, I felt a bit excited about the work ahead. Something flipped in me. I am still gloomy and all that - but also a little excited for the way ahead.

I have been thinking and reading a lot about how to streamline and diversify our software agency. Looking back, I think I was very much lost in working with clients, getting things done, and taking over client projects as my own that I forgot to do the strategic work required to keep things smooth and about "scale". This helped to build trust with clients and I learned a lot about building and working with people - but it also came at a cost. I have been reading online resources, listening to podcasts, and I have a few books in my TBR list related to this.

I was also lucky to have witnessed [Buffalo Intellectual](https://www.instagram.com/buffalo.intellectual) perform live in Blr. Buffalo Intellectual is an Ambedkarite professor and researcher who writes about Savarna culture, and their podcast is hilarious while also serving as a reality check for my Savarna self. You can listen to the podcast [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/70Y6Y8FtCo6EFDfF6Xmogb). I really enjoyed their live show - and highly recommend it if they are performing in your city.

I also haven't felt like doing any photography work this week.

I completed listening to this audio drama - [Jackie the Ripper](https://open.spotify.com/show/3FDmPm1IGDXh7GCxQq5vvP). Imagine Jack the Ripper, but the serial killer is a woman and is based in 2021 or 2022 Whitechapel.

I really enjoyed this and highly recommend it.

Another that I am currently listening to is [Sherlock & Co](https://open.spotify.com/show/5yfvdowY1nFCyXRTD5ITqb) - Sherlock Holmes, but in 2024, and Dr. John Watson is a modern-day podcaster.

I also enjoy reading weekly notes, mostly from people recommended through [Thejesh's blog](https://thejeshgn.com/) posts. It feels nice to get a peek into the life of other strangers every week. It has become almost a ritual. I should probably get a blogroll out?

Speaking of Thejesh - I have been pondering whether I should migrate from Hugo to WordPress. I would really like some kind of "programmability" into my blog and expand it into a playground for experiments. At the top of my mind, I want to build a blogroll and mess around with ActivityPub and some more IndieWeb madness.

Till next week -
