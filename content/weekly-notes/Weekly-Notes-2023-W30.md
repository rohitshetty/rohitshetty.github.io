## Last Week(2023W30)

This week was low on productivity, but I was able to get good sleep (more than 7 hours). Hopefully, this streak of good sleep continues.

I have restarted using [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/), but I forget to turn it on regularly, and I am still facing issues in getting it to work with systemd (or some other way to launch it on boot).

I watched Oppenheimer this week with my Beneathatree team. What is there to say about this that has not already been said?

On Saturday, we had a team hackathon where we attempted to build a two-wheeler robot. We started by exploring ESP8266 and built the robot chassis. The plan is to start coding next week. It was a fantastic experience.

Saturday was also my 4th Urdu class. We learned about the connector forms of the Bey family. I am surprised every time I can decipher even a little bit of [Nastaliq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastaliq) writing I come across.

For example:

I can now write small words (though with lots of effort and mistakes) like

[Akshitha](https://www.instagram.com/urdusaathi/) is an amazing teacher who teaches Urdu through Pop culture - check her out in case you too want to give it a try.

Ended the week with dinner at [Basaveshwara Khanavali](https://goo.gl/maps/FKmPS6Pu7J3588Qo6), along with Girish and Anil.

This [Khanavali](https://alar.ink/dictionary/kannada/english/%E0%B2%96%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%B5%E0%B2%B3%E0%B2%BF) serves North Karnataka Lingayat cuisine. The ambiance is that of a cafe (I joked that it is a gentrified Khanavali), but the taste was homely, and their thali was unlimited.
Their staff was really hospitable - they kept encouraging us to have more and relish all their items.

I have been thinking/working on a few ideas for the blog.

- I finally have an AWS account I can use - I want to move my images there and use S3 as my image host. I always felt awkward committing the images into git.

- I was able to export my sleep log into graphs - I want to explore more to see what I can track easily and export. I have been logging my satisfaction with productivity since last week

- I have [[devlog]] in logseq, where I write about some problems I may have solved. I am working on a script to automatically sync it into my blog here (Maybe with a different RSS feed, to avoid having to pollute this)

## Interesting Internet

[blr.on.this.day](https://www.instagram.com/blr.on.this.day/) - This is an interesting Instagram page I have been following for several weeks. It uses the archives of Bangalore Spectator (1877-1895) sourced from the [British Newspaper Archive](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/titles/bangalore-spectator). The page posts about interesting things that happened on this day. I have come across several fascinating gems, and I would like to document them in one place. Perhaps a blog post is due?

[Arduino Robot Car with Speed Sensors - Using Arduino Interrupts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQQpAACa3ac&ab_channel=DroneBotWorkshop) - While preparing for my team's hackathon, I had to do some initial research, and I found this video useful.

[Nobody cares about your blog](https://www.alexmolas.com/2023/07/15/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html) - An article about why nobody cares about your blog, but why you should still blog.

This reminds me of lines from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-99yoLymF8) poem by [G.S. Shivarudrappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._S._Shivarudrappa):

ಎಲ್ಲ ಕೇಳಲಿ ಎಂದು ನಾನು ಹಾಡುವುದಿಲ್ಲ\
ಹಾಡುವುದು ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯ ಕರ್ಮ ನನಗೆ

ಕೇಳುವವರಿಹರೆಂದು ನಾನು ಬಲ್ಲೆ ಅದರಿಂದ\
ಹಾಡುವೆನು ಮೈದುಂಬಿ ಎಂದಿನಂತೆ\
ಯಾರು ಕಿವಿ ಮುಚ್ಚಿದರೂ ನನಗಿಲ್ಲ ಚಿಂತೆ.

"I sing for no one\
 I seek no audience; you see\
 Singing is what I do,\
 A sheer necessity.

I know there are those who will listen\
And so I sing my song\
If someone were to cover their ears\
I take no offense and go on."
