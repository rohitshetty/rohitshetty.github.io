I missed updates for 2024W14 and 2024W15. I have been busy and hardly had any energy or time due to being busy.

We were in the process of moving our office from Domlur to Koramangala. The first phase of that was completed this week, with all our software team moving to the new office and starting to work from here. I have been on the ground for the last two weeks along with some of my colleagues and cofounders working to make the office ready for moving in while also balancing work on my client projects. My colleagues have been on ground for longer, since months, and have been doing all the heavy lifting. I am eternally thankful to be part of this team.

This new office is an old bungalow that has been used as an office for almost a decade by one of our earlier clients. This new building has a character of its own, but also comes with hectic work we had to do to make it work for us. Next, we still have our Makerspace, Archives, and Library to be moved.
I am excited about this new space for what it has to offer. I specifically enjoy our outdoor space, where I take my evening break, brew my coffee, and sip it in peace amongst greenness and the chirping birds.
Maybe I'll put up some images once we settle in :)

I'll want to write a post about this experience once I find time, and also about our journey through various offices we had.

## In Other News

- I continued my couch to the 5K training program. This week was Week 5. I can barely make it through running for 12 minutes and walking for 2 minutes for two laps. Last 2 weeks, I went on the run 3 times a week. I never thought I could push this much. I am learning to trust the process.
- This weekend is [TCSWorld10K](https://tcsworld10k.procam.in/)! I am running the 5K there. This is what I have been preparing for.
- I think I missed a few gym sessions, but I have attended at least one session per week out of the three.
- I fell a bit off the bandwagon on diet due to lack of time. I ordered from Swiggy for the first time in 2 months. And may have ordered 2/3 times so far because I was way too tired to cook. Earlier I would be disappointed, but I am learning to be kind to myself and picking off from where I left things off.
- I lost 10 kg in 2 months. I am now 104 kg. Still have a lot more to go :) A caloric deficit diet is what worked. I am adding in some kind of movement every day if possible. Either by running or in my gym classes, where we are doing bodyweight training this cycle.
- I uninstalled the Instagram app. I am still using the Instagram web app on my phone and laptop. I immediately saw the drop in my reel consumption, thanks to the terrible web experience. I want to completely deactivate Instagram - but, for now, I have just signed off from everywhere and don't plan to sign in soon.
- Endless scrolling is probably the most evil UI invention. Every morning I wake up and crave scrolling and the dopamine hits. My hand automatically goes into other apps that have this (YouTube Shorts, Reddit). I am trying to be mindful of this.
- I am enjoying the new bike ride from Indiranagar to my office in Koramangala every day. Ronin has been great so far. It is almost a month since I am using it.
- This weekend, I restarted Urdu Mashq again. We read some Satire works in Urdu from [Ibn-e-Insha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn-e-Insha) and Manto's [Aankhon par charbi](https://www.rekhta.org/afsanche/aankhon-par-charbi-saadat-hasan-manto-afsanche?lang=hi).
- I am yet to add an image gallery feature to the blog. Now with Instagram out of the question - maybe I'll prioritize this.
- It rained in Bangalore this week. I enjoyed the ride back that night through the Intermediate Ring road. The area around [Army Staff College Golf course](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YRwoxjPXycdpSZP6A) is densely green and It was amazing riding through it just after the rain.

Till next week -
