I am restarting weekly notes. Last year, I was able to write a few, but then I didn’t have enough structures in place to continue.

I want to write more about my work, but I cannot write more because of contracts. Maybe, I should do one just for the internal audience or maybe just for myself.

I worked from home for 3 days this week and worked from the office the rest. Back in December, I made the decision that I would work from home for 3 days just to settle in, and set up my work desk. I have been using a sit-stand desk from [ErgoYou](https://www.ergoyou.in/products/ergoyou-height-adjustable-desk-with-wood-grain-table-top-2-stage-motorized).

Ideally, I want to get to a place where I am working less than earlier (which is already happening; I am definitely working way less than before) and also, my energy is also spent, along with my current work, on bettering the agency, and maybe on some new product or revenue sources.

I made progress on the problem I have been stuck with for some time. I am working on a deep learning problem, and could not get it working until this week. I was able to train the model and see some results - they seem promising, but nowhere near where we would want it to be. There are a few new approaches I will try next week, which I am excited about.

I have been waking up at about 430/5 am since last week. I wake up, make myself some coffee, and then spend some quiet time (which sadly, also means I get distracted, and spend it on Instagram - need to work on that this week). I plan my day roughly using pen and paper and then transfer it to [Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/) if time permits. Then I either go for a run or hit the box for morning class.

I also started, something I call “Just fucken run” this week. I define it as running at least 1 km every day for 6/7 days a week.

I ran 25km this week and ran 5/7 days.

I did a 10K long run on Sunday - I wanted to do more, but I was feeling fatigued, and my legs were strained, so I listened to the body, cut it short, and took it slow. Long runs are something I look forward to every week.

I was able to attend 3 sessions at the box.

I am not really being strict with my diet, and have been stagnant with the weight for the last 2-3 months, and want to change that this week. I have been finding it a bit tough due to everything going on with work - and will focus more on this week.

I met my school friend for breakfast impromptu on Saturday. He messaged me that he was in Bangalore, so post run I went to meet him, and we had our breakfast at Vidyarthi Bhavan. I don’t really get these super famous Bangalore Dosa places - mainly because of the crowd, but also the Brahminical aesthetics of these places. I hate having to wait for an hour, only to eat okay-ish Dosa.

It was fun talking to him, and I enjoyed our conversation that morning.

I finished my bag of [Anaerobic floral naturals](https://greysoul.coffee/products/anaerobic-floral-naturals-light-med-roast?_pos=1&_psq=Anaerobic+Floral+Naturals+%28Light-Med+Roast%29&_ss=e&_v=1.0) from GreySoul this week. I enjoyed brewing it with [Tetsu 4:6 pour-over](https://youtu.be/wmCW8xSWGZY).

I have ordered two more coffee beans this week - Bluetokai’s [12th Birthday Blend](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/roasted-and-ground-coffee-beans/products/12th-birthday-blend), and [Pranoy’s Pride](https://marcscoffees.com/product/our-coffees/marcs-single-estate-origin/medium-roast-marcs-single-estate-orgin/pranoys-pride/) from Marc’s coffee, which came recommended by a friend.

There is a free, 5K run/walkathon at Cubbon Park this weekend, on the 19th Organized by the Dept. of Agriculture, Karnataka Government. You can check out, and sign up [here](https://organics-millets.in/reg-itf-2025/smartrun.php). If you are in Bangalore, you should check this out. I remember attending this with my team, back in 2018. I was too tired to even complete the route and gave up mid-way. I remember it being organized really well. Now, after consistently running for the last several months, I look forward to this.

The theme of this week was anxiety, but also things falling into place. There is a baseline sadness and anxiety with existence itself, I think - which is the human condition. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need (for meaning) and the unreasonable silence of the universe (To quote Camus)

Till next week -
