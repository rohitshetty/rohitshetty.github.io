## Last week (2023W12)

I am writing this on a Monday morning, instead of Saturday or Sunday night.

Last week I had some good progress in my work. I am working with my therapist
to fix my sleep cycle and irregular food habits.

- Monday was very productive. I made good progress on the work front.
- Tuesday I spent a few hours reading through a lot of blogs. I added a lot of them
  into my feed reader. I want to work on adding a blog roll, automatically exporting
  my feed from Miniflux.

- Wednesday was a public holiday for Ugadi, and I didn't really do much. I went to Thippsandra with a friend to buy a few things. I bought some plastic containers for organizing our maker space. We had our lunch at the newly opened [Filter Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/2t7erEB1qJpi2SWe8), where we ordered some Idly and ghee dosa. The food was good. I tried their hazelnut south indian filter coffee. I liked the after taste.

- Wednesday - I unboxed our
  new Oscilloscope that had arrived, and set it up.

- Wednesday I tried testing the UV tube light and Ballast that I had ordered.
  I was happy to see they worked together. I plan to use it for my Homebrew PCB experiments.

- Thursday, Friday mostly work.

- Saturday - The laminator I had [ordered](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08GX6XW54/) arrived. I went in for a slightly costly model this time.
  Because the el cheapo one stopped working previously. This one had temperature control, which turned out to be very useful.
  I experimented with laminating my Copper clad with Dry resist film and that worked great.

- Saturday - I ordered a few screen printing supplies and tools from [Printride](https://printride.com). I went there in search of transparency sheets for my inkjet printer, but ended up buying few other things that can be useful. They have an [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Printride) channel if that is of interest.

- Sunday I spent first half of the day continuing my experiments with Homebrewing PCB.
  I was able to make this test pattern.
  The result was not that impressive as I expected. But I think I know how to improve this further.
  I think it can make about 12 mils trace with 12 mils width easily. Potential to go down to 10 mils.
  I used the new laminator and then used the UV tube and ballast I had ordered previously.
  I had a few learnings on the way, as I had to repeat 2-3 times because I messed up at each step.
  I had FeCl<sub>3</sub> etchant I had saved up from last year.
  I have ordered 3 more UV tube and Ballast to build my own UV exposure units.

- Sunday I spent some time to add a now page, and blog roll. But because I am still new to hugo - I have some issues.
  Hoping to get it working soon.

- This week I used ChatGPT at work. I used it for helping me with some boring schlep. That was nice!

- I plan to sign up for an AWS account for S3. I don't really like that I have my media committed to git.

- I got in touch with [Taylor](https://taylor.town/) after reading this [post](https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications). I got intrigued about nowify that is mentioned in the post. Search engines didn't really throw up anything except [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34881237) Orange website comment by Taylor. I reached out to them asking about nowify.
  Taylor was gracious enough to send me a copy for the code. I am yet to deep dive into it. Looks like I was not the only one (In fact 4 more people had reached out earlier to Taylor this month itself).

- I bought a subscription to brain.fm - Will report back after few weeks of use.

## Interesting Internet

- [Exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/@Exurb1a) is fast becoming my favorite youtube channel. I recommend this [animated story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g1pmHSWHe0) and [this video about Buddhism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2wLyhgeYsw) that I loved.

- [This](https://manuelmoreale.com/passionless-web) article by [manuelmoreale.com](https://manuelmoreale.com/) captured and articulated some of my feelings about the web. I am always in search of blogs to follow by actual humans, rather than the content mills.

- [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) Inspired me to start working on my now page. WIP!

- [Loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwp-C7DBcYg&ab_channel=TheBritishMuseum) this video about how old night clocks worked.

- [This article](https://adactio.com/journal/20040) by [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/about/) is interesting and I think is how we should think about these new LLM tools, instead of hyping them up relentlessly like they are going to rule over us. Conditions apply.

- If you made it till here, you deserve some of the Orange cuteness.
