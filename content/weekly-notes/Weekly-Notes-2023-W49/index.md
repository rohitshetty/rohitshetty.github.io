## This week

- Last week was crunch time; I had to work over the weekend because of a client demo. That spilled well into Tuesday this week.

- I have been sleeping well, but mostly going to bed by the morning - I don't like this.

- Most of this week I barely did much and attended status meetings to follow up on tasks.

- Mostly low on energy and feeling gloomy again.

- Updated this blog on the 6th with a [new entry](/post/your-battery-is-running-low/).

- A couple of weeks ago, I migrated this blog from GitHub Pages to S3 + Cloudfront. I planned to add images to my blog and didn't want to encounter any size issues with either Git or GitHub Pages.

- Created [https://silverhalide.kernelanxiety.dev](https://silverhalide.kernelanxiety.dev) as a place to post all my analog images that I make. I used [foto](https://github.com/waynezhang/foto). You can find the source [here](https://github.com/rohitshetty/silverhalide.kernelanxiety.dev).

- I store my images on S3, then I have an `images.yml` file in both Silverhalide and this blog. It downloads the images during build time from my S3 store and deploys the build output to another S3 bucket connected to Cloudfront.

- I am on Pixelfed since the last few weeks - you can find me [here](https://pixelfed.social/rohitshetty).

- I have been thinking about [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) for Instagram stories, but I cannot really find a way. I may just post to Instagram + post to my website somehow.

- I have been using [this online](https://github.com/hemorej/darkroom-timer) darkroom timer by [Jerome Arfouche](https://github.com/hemorej). Earlier, I had [contributed](https://github.com/hemorej/darkroom-timer/pull/36) a simple bug fix.

- I had a few feature requests for the darkroom timer. I raised a [PR](https://github.com/hemorej/darkroom-timer/pull/52) for one of them this week. Hopefully, it goes through. I have also forked it and want to add a few ancillary features which may not get merged into the upstream. I also want to self-host this.

- I am rewatching "Dexter" - Finished Season 2.

- On Saturday, I processed the film I shot from W48 to W49. I "pushed" the film for the first time. Here are some of the images that I think are decent.

  You can find the entire roll [here](https://silverhalide.kernelanxiety.dev/#2023w48w49), with some details on development.
