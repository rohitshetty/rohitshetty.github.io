I went back to the [gym](https://www.instagram.com/greyboxfunctionaltraining/) this Tuesday after not attending it for almost a month because of bouts of depression, work overload, and travel. \
I was back with some optimism and new energy, and then I fell ill.

I caught a cold and was in bed most of Wednesday and Thursday.

Friday, I completed the last few frames remaining in the Kodak DoubleXX roll by taking photos of my office and colleagues. \
I loaded the camera with Fomapan 400 as I wanted to take some pictures while also being out for work.

On Friday, I had to be out most of the day for an internal project. I had traveled across the city in search of some items for the project. Had to find vendors and get things done. \
This is different from my usual responsibilities - and away from the screen, so I enjoyed it. It was full of last-minute frenzy, but my ADHD saved me.

I took a few images at Avenue Road.

My new coffee beans are here this week. I ordered [Blue Tokai's 11th Birthday Blend](https://bluetokaicoffee.com/products/11th-birthday-blend) after reading about it in the [IndiaCBC](https://www.instagram.com/indiacbc/)'s Discord. \
I am yet to open it. \
For the last few weeks, I have enjoyed [Kapikottai's Curveball](https://kapikottai.coffee/products/curveball) brewed with an Aeropress.

It has become a ritual of sorts for the last few days. I wake up around noon, make my Aeropress, put up a story on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rohitshetty00/) with the coffee, and practice my Urdu by posting the caption in Urdu. I enjoy doing this.

Sunday, after waking up at 1 PM, I went on a photo walk. I was out for 3 hours and was back when the sun set.

I was not super inspired and probably was not that careful in metering or framing, but I did take photos - which made me happy. Having a camera in hand means that I end up talking to people I would not usually - and that makes me happy too. Plus, it also is a fun way to get in the steps.

I learned something new this week - more than learning, this was probably a changed outlook.

I have always been chubby. As a kid, I was bullied and mocked for this. My mother was/is eternally worried.

My nickname in school was "डबल्य" (fatty) in Marathi.

Each time I attend a family or extended family event, many relatives magically turn into doctors immediately and be super concerned about my health.

_"Oh you have added on some weight"_ - Thanks, Sherlock. I never had access to a mirror.

_"You know, walk for an hour every day"_, _"You need to cycle"_, _"Do yoga"_, _"First thing in the morning, mix lemon and honey in warm water and drink"_, _"Stop eating any fried food"_, _"Don't be on an empty stomach for a long time"_, _"Sleep early and wake up early"_

Each time these people threw in that generic advice and useless pseudoscience quackery at me, a puppy died in heaven. Of boredom.

We moved home during my high school years, and for my 9-12 standard, I ended up cycling for about 15km a day. This did help me lose some weight - but people forgot to tell me that. So I continued to live in that shame.

Then college happened, I stayed within walking distance, and was busy anyway - no more physical labor - I ended up gaining back more weight. After moving to Bangalore, the same thing continued, only more busy now. I weigh now about 110 kg.

I didn't have time to focus on this. I had different priorities and was already suffering - Surely I didn't want to suffer more?

I have also been seeing a weird "pipeline" in the wild.

I termed this "fitness to pseudoscience/spirituality" pipeline.

Whenever I find someone I know, either famous or in IRL goes into a "fitness" mode, in a few months they end up being "Spiritual", along with the whole manifestation-loving-i$ha-$adguru-hyping-ayurveda-peddling shebang.

8eer8iceps is a famous example.

All of this made me very much resistant to the idea.

But what changed was I learned about [TDEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_expenditure) and Calorie deficit this week. I didn't know that the majority of what I eat goes into being alive.

So, to reduce weight, all I need is simple math.

`If (Calorie_Intake - TDEE) < 0 then weight_loss();`

Even without exercise - if I eat with a calorie deficit, there is going to be a weight loss. \
Even if I end up eating junk - I'll lose weight. \
(I **know** why the above two, even though they will lead to weight loss, are not ideal and healthy - I am just here making my case of why it flipped a switch in me).

I missed this memo - maybe because our educated Indian middle class and media are busy peddling pseudoscience quick hacks rather than focusing on first principles.

Now this does not feel like a vague "Exercise and eat healthy" thingy - It is quantifiable.

So now, I'm being careful about what I eat, and I am trying to be in a Calorie deficit. I want to continue my gym too - mainly because I am enjoying it (to an extent).

Till next week -
