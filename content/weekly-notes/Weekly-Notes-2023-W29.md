I missed adding notes for W26, W27, and W28 due to ongoing sleep issues and low productivity, which left me with little energy to gather my thoughts and write. Although I continue to log things in logseq, compiling and fixing the grammar consumes much of the energy I lack.

## W26, W27, W28

Weeks W26 to W28 were primarily focused on work with only a few noteworthy events:
But here are things I would like to document:

- On June 30, I found out that Raspberry Pi's are back in stock after being unavailable for hobbyists for 2 years due to the COVID chip shortage. I ordered a few for our makerspace.

- There was some great news from two of our clients:

  - One of the client projects I work on at Beneathatree is for [Uplift](https://uplift.ai/). Uplift was in the news recently as they were used by MLB for player scouting - [here](https://www.wsj.com/sports/baseball/mlb-draft-artificial-intelligence-97522ebf?mod=djemalertNEWS) [are](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/major-league-baseball-embraces-3d-motion-tracking-to-scout-players/) [some](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/2023/06/28/Technology/mlb-uplift-labs.aspx) news articles about it.

  - Another one of our client for whom I work is [Digifarm](https://digifarm.io/). We recently [launched the private beta for an exciting product I have been working on for many weeks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/digifarming_partial-deep-resolution-product-get-ready-activity-7081941687723335680-5EWM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

- There is a [new food truck that serves specialty coffee now at Indiranagar 6th main](https://www.instagram.com/tribalcoffee.co). I have been going there pretty much every day for my evening coffee ever since I discovered it on the 5th of July. It ends up adding a break to the day, and the coffee is also good.

  While we are at coffee, I have been enjoying Savor Works' [Fruits Bomb](https://www.savorworksroasters.com/products/fruits-bomb) for my morning pourover.

- I published [this](/post/interstitial-automate-logseq/) article about how I automated Logseq Interstitial journaling.

  I have been practicing interstitial journaling, but it is not as regular or detailed as I would like it to be.

- Started on [Quetiapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine) on July 13th. This has been helping with sleep.

- I joined online classes for Beginners Urdu literacy - [Shuruaat-e-Urdu](https://pages.razorpay.com/B26Shuruaat) run by [Akshita](https://www.instagram.com/akshita.works/?hl=en). This course enables a learner to be able to read and write short sentences in Urdu's Perso-Arabic script in just 9 weeks, Inshallah.

## Coffee, Dopamine and sleep

During W26 and W27, I experienced sleep issues and a gloomy mood generally. Restarting coffee consumption seemed to help. Quetiapine has been relatively effective for improving my sleep, but it comes with a side effect - vivid dreams, which makes my sleep more interesting. To optimize dopamine, I started taking cold showers in the morning and maintained regular coffee intake, having either pour-over or aeropress in the morning and an americano in the evening

## Last Week(2023W29)

Monday and Tuesday were mostly work, nothing log-worthy happened. I have been having regular deep sleep and have mostly been going to bed at night.

Wednesday was my 10,365th day on earth. I got reminded of [this](https://evanp.me/2023/07/18/20000-days/) because of a post by [Evan Prodromou](https://cosocial.ca/@evan).

Thursday, I ordered a cassette player to explore the music we have in cassettes at our Archive. I discovered [Nirvana Unplugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Unplugged_in_New_York) because of that. I have been listening to Nirvana.

On Friday, my colleague, H, conducted an informal workshop on GraphQL. He showed us the project he had built to explore GraphQL.

On Saturday, I had my third Urdu class. We explored the concept of connector/non-connector words, along with how some characters change their shape in Nastaleeq script. Did you know that in Urdu, usually, the 'e' and 'u' vowels are left to be interpreted by the reader based on context?!

Later that evening, Arpana dropped by. We took a walk to Tribal coffee co truck and then had our dinner at our favorite place for Kerala food - Salt mango tree.

I worked on a script to parse my Logseq sleep log to chart my sleep timing and duration.

Here is how my sleep time has been changing over the weeks. You can see some stability (yet to be proved if this is substantial) after I got on new meds.
