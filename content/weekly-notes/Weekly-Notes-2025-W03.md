I woke at 4:30 am this morning, planning to run the Millet run at Cubbon Park. It started to rain suddenly. I went to Cubbon Park with a friend, and we waited until 7 am for the rain to stop. It didn’t. They flagged off the run, but we decided not to risk it due to health reasons. I enjoyed a small run in the dark at Cubbon Park, while my friend waited near the Cubbon Park metro.

This week felt chaotic. I ran only 3-4 days, totaling 8 km. I had decided to take it slower earlier in the week due to unusual pain in my shins. It improved later in the week. I took 2 days off from workouts. I strength-trained 3 days at the box and completed the WoD on the remaining 2 days. I have been mostly off my diet.

Last week, I had planned to run at least 1 km 6 out of 7 days a week, along with my regular training, but I decided not to do it and take it slower. I am also working on preparing a training plan for this year. I want to improve in 10K and half marathons this year.

Regarding work, this week was mostly calm. I am currently stuck on a project issue: the model I am training performed better previously, but now, with more data, it is overfitting. I still need to read more about how to handle this. I am also reading about how to modify the training script so I can run it on an HPC system (on multi-node, multi-GPU systems) to iterate faster.

I have been reflecting on nurture and care. I want to get better at offering help, empathy, and care to my friends and family. I am not particularly good at this and want to change that.

I have been experimenting with [Pranoy’s Pride Coffee](https://marcscoffees.com/product/our-coffees/marcs-single-estate-origin/medium-roast-marcs-single-estate-orgin/pranoys-pride). It works well at higher coffee:water ratio. I also made [immersion iced coffee](https://youtu.be/8uGGeV8A-BM) using Bluetokai’s Birthday blend, which turned out a bit chocolatey.

The theme of this week was being thrown out of balance but being patient, and accepting.

_Edward Hopper_\
I spent some time on Monday searching for Hopper's artwork. I find Hopper’s style of artwork really attractive. It defines urban alienation, and some of his artworks capture the essence of what I like in street photography. I also like his use of color in artwork—its desaturated nature adds to the theme.

I enjoyed reading through this article about his various artworks. [Link](https://www.playforthoughts.com/blog/edward-hopper)

_Jrnl_\
I came across this command-line-based journal. I like the idea of doing things without leaving my terminal, but I am yet to use it more.\

_The Pizza Show_\
I keep revisiting this mini-show on YouTube every few years. I enjoy the infectious enthusiasm and pride people take in their work in these interviews. I also love the interviewer, who himself is a master pizza maker. This reminds me that quality work requires people who love what they do, which in turn requires fair pay, respectable working conditions, and a nurturing environment.
