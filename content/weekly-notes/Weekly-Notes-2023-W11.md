## This week

- **Nibling++**: My cousin, with whom I spent countless summer vacations growing up, is now a proud parent. It's crazy how fast time flies and how life changes.

- **Update on Tempus**: Starting of this week, I spent some time working on [Tempus.](/weekly-notes/weekly-notes-2023-w10/) I changed the orientation to landscape and added code to display the keypad and identify key presses. However, I noticed that there were some issues with a single key press being interpreted as a series of key presses, so I plan to add some debouncing or filtering features to fix this problem.

- **New Oscilloscope**: Our [Makerspace](https://bat.school) has just acquired its [first oscilloscope](https://siglentna.com/product/sds1104x-u/), which is fantastic news! I've been wanting to get one for a long time, ever since my undergraduate days. It's an incredibly versatile tool that will be useful for a wide range of projects and experiments.
  Of course, like with any new technology, there is a bit of a learning curve. While I'm excited to start using it, I'm also a bit apprehensive. I know there's always the chance that I could accidentally damage the oscilloscope, but I've been reading and learning more about it in my spare time.

- **Fidget Cube**: I bought a [fidget cube](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BS48S6YX). It was relatively cheap. However, I don't really like the feel of it because some of the buttons are hard and stiff. I'm planning to build one for myself someday.

- **Aakash Mehta Live**: I watched [Aakash Mehta](https://www.instagram.com/kuchbhimehta/?hl=en) live [today](https://in.bookmyshow.com/events/aakash-mehta-nasty-stand-up-comedy/ET00353906) for the first time. I like and listen to the podcast ["Vartalab"](https://ivmpodcasts.com/ivm-show/varta-lab-61e571e4adf87e3b1d5905bd) that Aakash and [Navin Noronha](https://www.instagram.com/houseofnoronha/?hl=en) run. I'm looking forward to seeing Navin live next. Link to [Navin's](https://in.bookmyshow.com/events/navin-noronha-the-good-child-final-tour/ET00352601) tour.

- **Struggling with Sleep and Focus**: This week was the worst in recent times. I had a lot of issues with sleep and focus. On Friday and Saturday, I slept for most of the day, and in the previous few days, I hardly slept at all. I'm having trouble getting things done. I'm exploring a few tools to help me, including continuing to use Sunsama. I've also installed [Forestapp](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to prevent distractions and I'm exploring brain.fm

## Interesting Internet

- I have been scouring the internet for advice on the proper usage of an oscilloscope.
  I found these videos from [EEVBlog](https://youtu.be/xaELqAo4kkQ) and [Electroboom](https://youtu.be/DgYGRtkd9Vs) to be useful.

- My mind was blown with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3bJnKmeNJY&t=1125s&ab_channel=NightHawkInLight) video that demonstrates how paint can be used to achieve cooling without any electricity - pretty ingenious!

- If you made it till here, you deserve some of the Orange cuteness.
