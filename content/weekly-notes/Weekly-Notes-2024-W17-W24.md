I have been too busy or exhausted to write my notes here. Here are the updates, in not any chronological order:

1. Beneathatree completed the move into a new office. We are still working on setting it up.
2. Got the old Durst Enlarger to work and made my first darkroom print in our own darkroom
3. Ran TCS10K 5K race
4. Ran Bengaluru Runner's Jatre - 40 minutes
5. Lost about 20 Kg - was cooking most of my meals, until few weeks ago.
6. Deactivated instagram for few weeks and back. I see the "want" to check it every other second has reduced. I am still using the web
7. Started learning Rust whenever I can - working on project using Rust here.
8. Install arch on a spare laptop. Using this for non work context
9. Installed emacs on arch device and using it
10. Setup stow and started managing my dotfiles
11. I have been regular to the gym once the office moving completed. We are approaching the end of this cycle, where we focused on the Olympic weight lifting movements.
12. After the TCS10K, I have been off my running training plan. But I do run with intermittent breaks. I do want to work more on this.
13. I moved my work desk to makerspace, as we are keeping Orange, the cat there. We decided to move Orange from our old office, to the new one, as she was coming back injured everytime she went out. So we consulted Cat behaviour experts, cat proofed the office etc, and have been keeping her in our Makerspace, which is large enough, has vertical level etc for her stimulus. I have moved my work desk there until she takes into the new space to make her feel safe.
14. I visited my parent, and stayed back in Belgaum for 4 days.
