Hello world!

I love coming across blogs from the 2000s that document an era in tech and society that I lived through but know nothing about.
I love blogs that are more of a diary, a running commentary of a thought process of the project than a straightforward tutorial.

I do not plan to do any of those. But I wanted to keep a log of things I dabble in, read, and other random things that I do, outside of my day-to-day work.

Few Blogs that I find interesting (More to be added):

1. [Thejesh GN](https://thejeshgn.com/)
2. [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
3. [Jeff Attwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)
4. [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)
