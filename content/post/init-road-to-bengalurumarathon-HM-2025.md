A sub-2-hour half marathon. The goal feels audacious, almost impossible, when I say it out loud. It demands a relentless 5:40 min/km pace for 21.1 kilometers—a huge leap from where I am today. But that’s the goal I’ve set for the Bengaluru Marathon this September.

Just a year ago, I was training for my first 5K at the TCS World 10K 2024 (Completed 5K in 50 minutes).\
Since then, I’ve run a few 5Ks, 10Ks, and Half marathons. I completed my first half marathon last year at the Mangalore Marathon 2024 (Time: 2:44:11).

I trained for TCS World 10K 2025 (April 27th), aiming for a sub-1-hour finish, but missed it by 2 minutes. I finally broke through the sub-1-hour target (59:44) in June. This was my first time training for a target, and hitting it. Last year was about surviving the distance.

I’ve registered for the [Bengaluru Marathon's Half Marathon](https://bengalurumarathon.in/) (September 21st, 2025). I’m training with the goal of completing the 21.1K distance in under 2 hours.

But I’ve got 12 weeks to prepare, of which 3 are already over.

## Training Philosophy

There were quite a few options when it came to training plans. I was exploring Jack Daniels’ method from his book "Daniels' Running Formula". I really liked the scientific approach to training there, but it lacked properly explained half marathon plans.

So, I selected [this plan](https://faq.coros.com/share/training/plan/462667235046113280/region-1-time-1750030219364) from Coros. I even spoke to Coros’ online coach, and they advised me to add 5–8K extra per week throughout.

I further modified it — removed one easy run, added a tempo run (explained below), and moved runs around so that Sundays and Thursdays are my rest days.

I’m using the [VDOT method](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)>) from Jack Daniels to arrive at training paces.

The plan is split into 3 phases, each 4 weeks long. Every 4th week is a deload week — with no intense workouts and reduced mileage, giving the body a chance to rebuild.

Mileage peaks at 62K in week 10, after which we taper down.

I’m continuing my strength training alongside this (making sure all muscles are targeted as realistically as possible).

### Different Kinds of Runs and Their Intentions

Jack Daniels talks about understanding the intention behind each workout so you can stay true to it — not overworking or underworking yourself, just doing the bare minimum required for optimum results.

To guide this, I use training paces from the [VDOT calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator). You enter your recent race details and it gives you training paces. Stick to them and you’ll train the right systems to improve overall fitness.

#### VDOT Workout Purposes

**Threshold**  
As you run, your body breaks down carbohydrates for energy and produces lactic acid as a byproduct. At lower intensities, your body can clear this efficiently. But at higher intensities, lactic acid builds up in the bloodstream, leading to fatigue.
Threshold runs train your body to process lactic acid more efficiently and mentally prepare you to hold the required pace.
It's a comfortably hard effort — the fastest pace you can sustain without blowing up. In VDOT terms, it’s your 60-minute race pace. It helps build endurance and improves your body’s ability to clear lactate. Typically done as a steady 20-minute run or broken into cruise intervals.

**Intervals**  
Teaches muscles and lungs to use oxygen efficiently. Builds your _VO₂max_.  
Stresses your aerobic power. At proper intensity, it takes about two minutes to hit VO₂max, so intervals are ideally 3–5 minutes long — enough time at intensity without tipping too much into anaerobic territory and building excess lactate.

**Long Runs**  
Mostly done for mental endurance.  
A sustained easy-to-moderate effort, usually 25–30% of weekly mileage. In VDOT, it's done at Easy pace — relaxed enough to hold a conversation. Builds aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and mental toughness.  
I deviate a bit here — I do it at a pace somewhere between Easy and Threshold.

**Easy**  
Easy runs promote physiological benefits and build the base for higher-intensity training. Strengthens the heart and improves blood flow and oxygen processing in working muscles. This is also known as Zone 2 runs. Where your heart rate is 65-79% of your HRmax

This training plan includes:

- 1 interval run
- 1 threshold run
- 1 long run
- 2 easy runs each week.

## What This Series Is

I write pre-run thoughts every day before heading out — mostly a log of how I’m feeling. Sometimes it’s a vibe check, sometimes more like a journal. Occasionally, I ramble off on a tangent.
All of this used to live in a Google Doc. Now, it’s going to live here — on the blog.

I'll also restart writing my weekly notes going forward, _Inshallah_.

## Story So Far

I’m currently in Week 4 of the training plan. It’s a deload week with a target mileage of 32K. No intense runs — all easy pace.

The last 3 weeks:

- Week 1: 40.27 km
- Week 2: 42.49 km
- Week 3: 47.74 km

I’ve been missing around 2–3K from the ideal targets.  
I’ve managed to hit a pace of 5'50" min/km for 7K during threshold workouts.

## What Am I Trying to Do Here

I don’t know if I can achieve this target — but this experiment will be interesting. And it’ll make me a better person, I think.

I’ve learned a few things about myself already: that I’m stronger than I thought. Growing up, I didn’t see myself as a strong person — mentally or physically. But over the last year, I’ve proven myself wrong. I’ve built this up brick by brick. And that means something.

I’ve come to love the discomfort and the pain — not in any macho David Goggins way, but in the sense of appreciating hard work and trusting the process.

My ADHD makes it hard to realise that I _was_ working hard - building business and learning to navigate things without a map, or that I _was_ disciplined putting in the long hours for many years.
But physical activity — running and lifting — makes it obvious.

I think of it as therapy. Not in a clichéd way, but like therapy in the sense that it helps you explore who you are and know what you’re capable of.

Through my earlier training cycles — especially during my 10K prep — I realised I’m happiest when I’m training. Mostly because this is the only part of my day I feel like I can fully control. I can show up, give my best — and let the rest fall into place.

This training journey has helped my mental health more than anything.  
I want to document this publicly — and see where it goes.
