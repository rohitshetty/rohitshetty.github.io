It was very early in the morning when I went to bed yesterday. I decided to stay back in the office yesterday night. Waking up by noon, I went through some emails and then decided to make myself a cup of coffee before jumping into the day.

Shashank has been bringing Bruce to the office regularly in the mornings, so Bruce gets familiarized with the office environment.

I spent some time with Shashank and Bruce in our office garden, grinding my coffee beans.

It was a calm Tuesday afternoon, disturbed aperiodically by the traffic on the 100ft road. Some birds often decide to chime in their thoughts too.

Bruce was happy exploring the garden and zooming around.

I made myself some coffee in a French Press, and I am writing this memory down as I sip in my hot coffee.

Here is to a bright-looking week ahead.
