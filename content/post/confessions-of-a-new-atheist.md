## Confession of a New Atheist

This morning, I am in urgent need of a God. It would be nice if I could order faith (that I have lost) over at https://amazon.in - same-day delivery guaranteed.

I'm feeling helpless and hopeless. I can't seem to tame myself or my flaws. I yearn to kneel before someone greater than myself and submit, hoping they will fix everything.

I see and understand why the notion of God exists, and why even intellectuals like Dr. Ambedkar, who suffered because of organized religion, emphasized the need for a religion as a foundation for a healthy society. He sought a religion based on ethics, not rituals or rules, one that doesn't foster hate, discrimination, or violence among brothers.

When I was younger, especially in times of helplessness, I found comfort in sending short prayers to God. I believed in a higher power that was also my friend, an all-loving God open to personal bargains.

But even then, when I believed in God, I continued to live as if God didn't exist. If I (a theist) believed God existed - whom I believed to be all-loving, a judge of kindness and fairness - then why did that not reflect in my actions? Why was I okay with cheating and lying through my teeth for my personal gain? I, with faith, acted as if I didn't have any. I was okay if another human being suffered for my greed, was okay if another human being was killed in the name of my religion. I was okay if another human being was denied entry into a place of worship or denied water to drink. My God was full of love - but was I? I would hardly tolerate anyone who was not like me.

In my early/mid-20s, I realized intellectually that we are on our own - there is no God above keeping an eye on us. But I continued to act like there was one above me in the moment of crisis.

In therapy, we discussed ["Magical Thinking"](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/magical-thinking). Prayer and personal bargain with God were my Magical Thinking. My actions or inactions have consequences; no amount of magical thinking can help that.

This loss of God results in losing that sense of purpose, that sense of "discipline" I had in doing things - because it was my duty.\
That loss of belief in "karma" - Which I believed that if I work hard, and was fair and true, I would eventually be okay.

Where does one go when I cannot control or discipline myself or my evil side, or cannot overcome my flaws? Why would I even work on those things, if I don't have a guarantee of returns?

**Very bad/basic understanding of philosophy ahead**

After losing my faith, I used to find solace in Existentialism - that life is inherently meaningless, but you are free to make up your own meaning. \
Go do things that make you happy. Build your meaning.
But this too does not end well for me; if one does not have "faith" (not necessarily in God) to a certain extent, we are back to square one.

Lately, I've been drawn to Absurdism. A video [here](https://youtu.be/Jv79l1b-eoI) explains it beautifully.

Absurdism, from what I understand, is a philosophical stance that the Universe and life are meaningless (or we do not have the capability to understand it - hence practically meaningless). But the human desire to find meaning, order, and logic in what is inherently meaningless is what makes life miserable - And Camus calls it **"The Absurd"**.

[Camus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/#ParCamAbs) proposes three possible responses to Absurdity of Life:

1. Suicide - The declaration that life is not worth living.
2. Philosophical Suicide (or leap of faith) - Accepting any other thing that would give you meaning, including religion or ideology (like the promise of Communism).
3. [Rebel in the face of Absurd - Accept and acknowledge the Absurd, and the futility of things, but carry on and live passionately in the face of Absurdity.](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/absurdity-with-camus/)

Intellectually, it makes sense. However, it doesn't reflect in my actions.

At the moment, all I can do is pray to the Late God - that this atheist can internalize the Absurd, fight, and live vicariously in the face of Absurdity. Amen.
