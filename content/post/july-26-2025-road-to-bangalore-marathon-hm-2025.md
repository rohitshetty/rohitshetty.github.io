**If you're wondering what this is about** - _One year ago I crawled through a 5K in 50 minutes—now I'm attempting the slightly unhinged goal of running a sub-2-hour half marathon, documented through daily brain dumps complete with training chaos, 5 AM existential crises, random tangents, and way too much heart rate data._

**Disclaimer: Posts are lightly edited with LLMs for grammar and spelling, but the sleep-deprived thoughts and stubborn optimism are 100% human.**

## Pre-run brain dumps

05:30 AM

I slept early last night and got 8 hours of sleep. But it wasn't restful sleep. I woke up several times, had lucid dreams. I also had intermittent pain in my stomach. I used to have this earlier — various reasons. Sometimes it was my appendicitis flaring up, sometimes food poisoning. But these cramps were painful. I've been awake for an hour now and have had no pain. So I'm guessing I'm all good.

I need to work on getting more deep sleep — just the quantity of sleep isn't enough. Will work on sleep hygiene.

Today's workout is a 12K long run at a comfortable pace. I wanted to do a progressive run, but kept it easy. This isn't enough to hit my mileage, but let's see. Also, I'm getting late; I should have left earlier, by 5:30 AM. This run will likely take 1.5 hours. I'm going to take the short route (5K) to Kanteerava and run the rest there.

Post run, we're planning some strength and WoD at the box.

Today, AN is getting admitted to the hospital to prep for his surgery on Monday. I plan to go with him by noon so we can figure out what needs to be done.

## Post-run thoughts

{{<strava "15237251878">}}

I didn't finish the workout. I gave up around 5.5K. I joined DD and MM to Kanteerava from the box. I didn't run from the box, as it was getting late by the time I got ready. The first 4 kilometers felt great. I was sticking to the pace, but by 4.5K I started feeling pain in my right hip flexors. I continued, but then slowed down and had to stop by 5.5K. This was really demoralizing. I was expecting to hit the workout, and make up for the weekly mileage.

Post workout, we had coffee at the IDC Kitchen, Indiranagar. I then walked around a bit, had my second coffee at Blue Tokai.

I didn't do much the rest of the day, except tried getting a pull-up, which went fine, and that felt good.
