Last week I developed the second roll of Eastman 5222.

This time I developed it at box speed, so no more fried [look](https://silverhalide.kernelanxiety.dev/#2023w51w52).

I Developed it in D-96 for 5 minutes and 50 seconds, 10% lesser than the recommended 6.5 minutes.

I also used this roll to test the Pentax K1000 camera and Pentax SMC 50mm 1.4 Prime lens.

I like the feel and experience of using the K1000, but it is a bit heavy for my taste. I do enjoy the heaviness, it feels "solid", but if I am carrying it around in one hand - it gets difficult, especially after being comfortable with P30T, but that shutter sound is soooo satisfying.

I learned and tried to use zone focusing for the first time. I am still trying to internalize it, especially because I have no sense of distance, it is challenging.

I also found that the zoom lens I had earlier (35-80mm) has a distance scale calibration issue, hence I found a few of the images a bit soft and blurry.

I really enjoyed using the 50mm 1.4 Prime lens - It worked as expected at low light with respect to exposure, but focusing at low light was a bit of a pain.

Initially I was really not happy with these results, and made me sad - but after giving it some time I feel it turned out okay.

## Some of the images I like

It looked like a crime scene, because of the cordoning. I tripped the shutter the instant I saw the old Sikh Person on his Scooter enter the scene, small thing - probably no one else will note, but I liked it" >}}

I wish I had given it a bit more light to make the shadows a bit more clear, especially around his book. ">}}
