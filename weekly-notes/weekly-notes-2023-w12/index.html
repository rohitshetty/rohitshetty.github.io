<h2 id=last-week-2023w12>Last week (2023W12)</h2>
<p>I am writing this on a Monday morning, instead of Saturday or Sunday night.</p>
<p>Last week I had some good progress in my work. I am working with my therapist
to fix my sleep cycle and irregular food habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monday was very productive. I made good progress on the work front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuesday I spent a few hours reading through a lot of blogs. I added a lot of them
into my feed reader. I want to work on adding a blog roll, automatically exporting
my feed from Miniflux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday was a public holiday for Ugadi, and I didn&rsquo;t really do much. I went to Thippsandra with a friend to buy a few things. I bought some plastic containers for organizing our maker space. We had our lunch at the newly opened <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/2t7erEB1qJpi2SWe8>Filter Coffee</a>, where we ordered some Idly and ghee dosa. The food was good. I tried their hazelnut south indian filter coffee. I liked the after taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday - I unboxed our
new Oscilloscope that had arrived, and set it up.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday I tried testing the UV tube light and Ballast that I had ordered.
I was happy to see they worked together. I plan to use it for my Homebrew PCB experiments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday mostly work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturday - The laminator I had <a href=https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08GX6XW54/>ordered</a> arrived. I went in for a slightly costly model this time.
Because the el cheapo one stopped working previously. This one had temperature control, which turned out to be very useful.
I experimented with laminating my Copper clad with Dry resist film and that worked great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturday - I ordered a few screen printing supplies and tools from <a href=https://printride.com>Printride</a>. I went there in search of transparency sheets for my inkjet printer, but ended up buying few other things that can be useful. They have an <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/Printride>Youtube</a> channel if that is of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday I spent first half of the day continuing my experiments with Homebrewing PCB.
I was able to make this test pattern.
The result was not that impressive as I expected. But I think I know how to improve this further.
I think it can make about 12 mils trace with 12 mils width easily. Potential to go down to 10 mils.
I used the new laminator and then used the UV tube and ballast I had ordered previously.
I had a few learnings on the way, as I had to repeat 2-3 times because I messed up at each step.
I had FeCl3 etchant I had saved up from last year.
I have ordered 3 more UV tube and Ballast to build my own UV exposure units.</p>

<p>Sunday I spent some time to add a now page, and blog roll. But because I am still new to hugo - I have some issues.
Hoping to get it working soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week I used ChatGPT at work. I used it for helping me with some boring schlep. That was nice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I plan to sign up for an AWS account for S3. I don&rsquo;t really like that I have my media committed to git.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got in touch with <a href=https://taylor.town/>Taylor</a> after reading this <a href=https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications>post</a>. I got intrigued about nowify that is mentioned in the post. Search engines didn&rsquo;t really throw up anything except <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34881237">this</a> Orange website comment by Taylor. I reached out to them asking about nowify.
Taylor was gracious enough to send me a copy for the code. I am yet to deep dive into it. Looks like I was not the only one (In fact 4 more people had reached out earlier to Taylor this month itself).</p>

<p>I bought a subscription to brain.fm - Will report back after few weeks of use.</p>

<p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@Exurb1a>Exurb1a</a> is fast becoming my favorite youtube channel. I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g1pmHSWHe0">animated story</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2wLyhgeYsw">this video about Buddhism</a> that I loved.</p>

<p><a href=https://manuelmoreale.com/passionless-web>This</a> article by <a href=https://manuelmoreale.com/>manuelmoreale.com</a> captured and articulated some of my feelings about the web. I am always in search of blogs to follow by actual humans, rather than the content mills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://nownownow.com/>nownownow</a> Inspired me to start working on my now page. WIP!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwp-C7DBcYg&ab_channel=TheBritishMuseum">Loved</a> this video about how old night clocks worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://adactio.com/journal/20040>This article</a> by <a href=https://adactio.com/about/>Jeremy</a> is interesting and I think is how we should think about these new LLM tools, instead of hyping them up relentlessly like they are going to rule over us. Conditions apply.</p>

<p>If you made it till here, you deserve some of the Orange cuteness.</p>
